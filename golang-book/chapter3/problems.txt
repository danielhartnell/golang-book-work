1. How are integers stored on a computer?

Computers use a base-2 binary system for working with numbers. In summary, we
could say that a computer stores integers in binary.

2. We know that (in base 10) the largest 1 digit number is 9 and the largest 2
digit number is 99. Given that in binary the largest 2 digit number is 11 (3),
the largest 3 digit number is 111 (7) and the largest 4 digit number is 1111
(15) what's the largest 8 digit number? (hint: 101-1 = 9 and 102-1 = 99)

11111111 or 255.

3. Although overpowered for the task you can use Go as a calculator. Write a
program that computes 32132 Ã— 42452 and prints it to the terminal. (Use the *
operator for multiplication)

4. What is a string? How do you find its length?

The len() function can be used to determine the length of a string. A string is
encapsulated in `` or "". A string is a series of characters with a definite
length.

5. What's the value of the expression (true && false) || (false && true) ||
!(false && false)?

true && false = false
false && true = false
!false && false = true

false || false || true = true

So, true? Confirmed!

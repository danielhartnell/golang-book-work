Newlines, spaces and tabs are considered whitespace because you cannot see them.

3. Our program began with "package main". What would the files in the "fmt"

They would begin with "package main".

4. We used the Println function defined in the "fmt" package. If we wanted to
use the "Exit" function from the "os" package, what would you have to do?

We would have to 'import "os"' and then call os.Exit.

prints "Hello, my name is Daniel".
